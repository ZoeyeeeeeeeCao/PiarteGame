  description: 'They say Blackwake is rich.

    They never say who pays   for it.

    We
    unload crates under gunpoint.

    We eat when allowed.

    We sleep when the
    Captain remembers we exist.


    Whatever he keeps locked inside that fort,

    it
    made him crueler than the sea ever did.'
