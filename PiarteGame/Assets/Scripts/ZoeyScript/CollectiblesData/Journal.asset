  description: "The sea will not let us rest.\nThe compass spins like it\u2019s mocking
    me, and the wind howls even when the sails are down.\n\nWe followed the map because
    we believed in the promise \u2014 not of gold, but of command.\nThe Stone was
    real. I felt it hum beneath my palm.\n\nThat was our mistake.\n\nMen argue now.
    Trust has thinned like rope left too long in saltwater.\nSome say we should turn
    back. Others would kill to keep going.\n\nIf anyone finds this journal, know
    this:\nthe treasure takes more than it gives.\n\nI fear we are already too deep
    to escape."
