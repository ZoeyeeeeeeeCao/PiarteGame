  displayName: Havenport Isle Relic
  category: 1
  description: Forged long ago to protect the first pirates who settled Havenport
    Isle, the Hearthstone embodies home, loyalty, and legacy. Its golden core glows
    faintly when held by one of true blood, responding to courage rather than greed.
    Though calm in appearance, it is said to be the anchor that binds the other stones
    together.
